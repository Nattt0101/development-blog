# development-blog
A blog on what I have learnt from week 1 onwards!

# Week 2
- Sematic HTML, which makes the sections of the website more accessible to users who rely on assistive 
technologies to use the web.

- Common Element: (header, article, nav, section, table, details, figure, form, aside, main, mark)

- Inspector mode: enables users to make and view temporary changes on the spot.

- Device Mode: The device mode allows you to toggle devices for preview and testing.

CSS:
- selector { property: value;}

- <p style="text-align: 
left;">Just a sentence</p>

-<link rel="stylesheet"
href="basic.css" type="text/css">

- @import: 
● Set of style rules defined in 
an external file
● Should appear as a first rule 
in an external stylesheet
● Used to chain multiple 
external files together

- HASH symbol for ID name. Unique to that element.

- PERIOD symbol for class name. Selects any element.

- In CSS, an ID is #
// change the color of the element with id "main"
#main {
color: black
}
// change the color of the element with class special
.special {
color: black
}
You can specify a HTML tag and a class to be more specific
// for all <p> with the class special
p.special {
}
You can target a children element that is in a parent 
element
// all <a> inside the ID "main" html element
#main a {
}
  
- Link:
a:link { /* unvisited link */ color: red; }
a:visited { /* visited link */ color: blue; }
a:hover { /* moused over link */ color: green; }
a:active { /* current link */ color: purple; }
a:focus { /* focused link */ color: purple; }
  
- background-color: changes background color
  
 - Typography
  
 - web gradient

- Media Query:
  
 * Min-width
If the minimum width of the viewport is at least 
the specific width or wider, then the media 
query is true
  
 * Max-width
If the maximum width of the viewport is at no 
more than the specified width, or it’s narrower 
then the media query is true
  
Positioning
Relative
For tweaking the position of an element without affecting its 
surrounding boxes
Absolute
Take elements out of the static flow of the page and place 
relative to the browser window
Relative Absolute 
Allows us hook back into the static flow of the page
Fixed
Make elements don't scroll with the rest of the page (sticky)

* z-index property lets you control the 
depth of elements on the page.
Imagine the screen as a 3D world
Negative z-index go farther into the 
page. (behind)
Positive z-index comes out of the page
